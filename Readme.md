## Project Description

Our project is Campus Connect, which leverages Web3 and blockchain technology to provide a unified platform for students to access all information related to hackathon events, club activities, and academics. By integrating these features, Campus ensures a secure, transparent, and user-friendly experience where students can seamlessly track their engagements and stay updated on everything happening on campus. We are part of Team Aviators, and weâ€™re thrilled to showcase our project.
